rule_2b_structure           - Guidelines for organizing codenames in hierarchical structure

2b_ structural           - Rules for hierarchical structure of codenames

   a consistent          - Use consistent terms throughout the codebase, minimize 
                           different terms that refer to the same thing (ex: item vs 
                           element, get vs retrieve)
   b hierarchy           - Structure as objroot_objsub_attr_verb with objects/concepts first, 
                           verbs last (ex: user_profile_name_get not 
                           get_user_profile_name)
   c namespace           - Use namespaces to organize code into logical groups
   d readability         - Prioritize human readability over brevity where appropriate

2b3_ root                - Use approved general roots (prefixes) to organize code by domain:
   a app                 - entire application functionality
   b env                 - environment configuration and settings
   c dom                 - DOM operations and manipulations
   d ui                  - user interface components and visual elements
   e util                - utility functions for common operations
   f data                - data operations and management
   g auth                - authentication related functionality
   h error               - error handling and reporting

2b4_ root_new            - When a codename becomes too long (4 or more terms) then consider
   a simplification      - introducing a new root term for conceptual simplification
   b semantic_concept    - Each new root becomes its own semantic concept 
   c reference           - New roots can be referenced independently
   d example             - filter_search_button_clear â†’ clear_filter_button

2b5_ project_root        - Use these codename2 project-specific prefixes:
   a index               - codename index functionality and navigation
   b codename            - specific "term of art" for functions and variables
   c term                - term components within a codename structure
   d root                - first term of a codename operations
   e search              - search-related functionality and interfaces
   f filter              - filtering functionality and controls
   g lookup              - code snippet retrieval and display
   h reveal              - HTML & CSS codename reveal functions
   i prompt_name         - identifier for prompt sections in documentation
   j rule_name           - identifier for rule sections in documentation

2c2_ align               - Align symbols (=, :) in sequences for readability if not

   c columns             - Maintain columnar alignment for similar elements
   d spacing             - Use consistent spacing around operators and punctuation

2c3_ order               - Sort the codenames in .js files by their name,

                           alphabetically)
   b grouping            - Group related functions and variables together
   c consistency         - Maintain consistent ordering patterns across files

2c4_ compact             - In js files, no blank lines between functions, but blank 
   a js_spacing          - lines within function is ok.
   b css_spacing         - In css files, no blank spaces between class definitions.
   c readability         - Balance compactness with readability

   b title_align         - align rule titles at column 13
   c colon_align         - align colons at column 18
