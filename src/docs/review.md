# Project Review

This document provides a comprehensive review of the Codename project's structure, naming conventions, and functionality.

## Directory Structure Review

The project follows a well-organized, domain-driven directory structure:

```
codename/
├── public/               # Client-facing assets (PASS)
├── src/                  # Source code (PASS)
│   ├── components/       # UI components (PASS)
│   ├── lib/              # Core libraries (PASS)
│   ├── utils/            # Utility functions (PASS)
│   ├── assets/           # Source assets (PASS)
│   └── docs/             # Documentation (PASS)
├── curor_control/        # Development workflow (PASS)
└── [config files]        # Project configuration (PASS)
```

**Strengths:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Logical grouping by domain and responsibility
- Follows modern frontend best practices
- Consistent organization across directories

**Improvement Areas:**
- Consider adding a `src/views` directory for page-level components
- Add a dedicated `src/constants` directory for shared constants
- Missing automated test structure (`src/tests` or equivalent)

## Codename Convention Compliance

The project has established clear naming conventions:

| Convention | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| File naming (snake_case) | ✓ PASS | All files follow snake_case convention |
| Function naming (domain_action_target) | ✓ PASS | Consistent across modules |
| Boolean functions/variables (_is suffix) | ✓ PASS | Properly implemented |
| Collection naming (_list suffix) | ✓ PASS | Consistently applied |
| Parameter naming | ✓ PASS | Options pattern used appropriately |
| Documentation style | ✓ PASS | JSDoc format used consistently |

**Strengths:**
- Consistent naming across all modules
- Clear function naming that describes purpose
- Use of options pattern for parameters

**Improvement Areas:**
- Some functions could use more descriptive names
- Consider more specific domain prefixes in some utility functions
- More examples in documentation would be helpful
